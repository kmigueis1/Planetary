# Planetary
[Live Link](https://kmigueis1.github.io/Planetary/)

Planetary is a visualization that models the movement of a customized planetary system tailored to the user's specifications. The user can predetermine the number of celestial bodies in the system and other relevant properties and allow physics to take over when the visualization starts!

## Features

### Main Planetary View

The main view renders the currently created planets. By default, Earth's solar system is preloaded. Planetary orbit will be shown by a line.

### Side Bar

The user can choose to use the default solar system. The user can also choose to edit this solar system or create a custom one. Editable properties will include an explandable list of planets, their unique names, speeds, and eccentricities. The sidebar will include a time lapse slider to increase the animation speed. This should be a clean and engaging interface with sliders.


## Technologies
This project will use the React library. Planets will be rendered to the DOM using React. Planetary movement logic will be handled by JavaScript. Positions will be kept track of using a grid with coordinate positions
